This website is a collection of Houdini snippets in the form of VEX, Python, HDAs, or plain old project files.
The snippets serve as a backlog of setups and solutions for me, my collegues and anyone else who thinks they can use or learn from them.

<br>*This Houdini snippets [repository](https://github.com/RobbertGroenendijk/Houdini_snippets) is managed by [Robbert Groenendijk](https://robbert.xyz/)*<br>
